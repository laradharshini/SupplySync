# OTP Verification

- Uses **Firebase Authentication** to send OTP to the user's phone during signup/login.
- Verifies entered OTP before allowing access.
- For Testing: Use phone number - 9876543210 and OTP - 123456


# Order Status Workflow

1. Vendor places an order → Status: `Pending`
2. Supplier reviews and updates to:
   - `Confirmed`
   - `Shipped`
   - `Delivered`

# Future Enhancements
- Admin panel for system monitoring
- Chat between vendor and supplier
- Email notifications
- Dashboard analytics (charts, graphs)
- Responsive UI improvements
